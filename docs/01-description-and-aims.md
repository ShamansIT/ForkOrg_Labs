## Description and Aims

**ForkOrg Labs** is a fictional organisation within this lab, which plans to implement an internal **developer workflow** aimed at reducing the internal feedback loop during development in Salesforce: edit -> validate -> fix.
The proposed approach involves the introduction of a containerised **'preflight' stage**, which forms the evidence base necessary for decision-making before performing any deployment or merge actions.

According to the conditional scenario, the organisation **ForkOrg Labs** already partially applies **DevOps** practices - version control, peer review, basic CI checks. However, the quality of the decision-making process differs significantly between teams: risks are interpreted ambiguously, approval thresholds are not clearly defined, and the rationale for decisions on releases is not recorded in a form suitable for reuse. As a result, this leads to unnecessary rework, unsuccessful validations, and poor traceability of the reasons why certain changes were advanced further along the life cycle.

This lab uses the IEEE Standard for DevOps, with a focus on the Decision Management process (Section 6.3.3). The work begins with a gap analysis between the requirements of the standard and current practice, followed by a practical approach to improving the quality of SDLC by unifying evidence, clearly delineating decision-making powers, and automating where appropriate.

### Objectives of laboratory work:
1.	Conduct a gap analysis between the requirements of **IEEE DevOps Decision Management (6.3.3)** and current decision-making practices in ForkOrg Labs.
2.	Develop a workable approach to decision management that supports faster, evidence-based decisions and improves traceability throughout the lifecycle.
3.	Identify the types of solutions that can be **pre-authorised** and implemented in the form of automated gates for low-risk changes.
4.	Describe the **minimum set of evidence** required to support decision-making and form effective feedback loops for continuous improvement.
